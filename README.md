# Loan-Repayment-Prediction

->Investors (lenders) provide loans to borrowers in exchange for the promise of repayment with interest. That means the lender only makes profit (interest) if the borrower pays off the loan. However, if he/she doesnâ€™t repay the loan, then the lender loses money.

->Given historical data on loans handed out, with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), I have tried to build a model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when we get new potential customers we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.

->I have used a subset of the Lending Club Data set obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

->In this project I have illustrated the following concepts:
    -Exploratory Data Analysis
    -How to deal with missing values.
    -Convert categorical string features to dummy variables.
    -Build, Train and Evaluate a Sequential Model on the data.
